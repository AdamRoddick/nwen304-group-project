## Project Overview

This project is part of our course and contributes to 30% of the total grade. Below are some important dates to keep in mind:

### Important Dates

**Project Progress Presentation**: October 03, 2023

**Project Submission**: October 20, 2023

**Group Presentation and Interview**: October 24 and October 25, 2023

### Project Scope

- We can choose any scenario for our application, however we have chosen to go with a simple social media web application
- The Read functionality is available to any user and does not require authentication.
- Create, Update, and Delete functionalities are available only to authenticated users (logged in users for their own posts)

In this project, we are required to implement two flavors of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in Node.js:

**a) RESTful Web Application (GUI included)**: A complete Server Side rendered app that supports CRUD functionality on a back-end database.

**b) RESTful Web Service (without a GUI)**: Expose any two of the CRUD functionalities implemented in part (a) as JSON-based RESTful services.
